# Deep Learning

This is a repository meant to document my education of Deep Learning.  It includes the 5 projects from the Udacity Deep Learning curriculum.  It demonstrates the ability to train deep neural networks to solve a variety of AI related problems.

## Projects
### 1. Neural network

A simple neural network from scratch to make predictions of bike-sharing usage. See [here for the completed project](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/deep-learning/blob/master/project1/neural-network.ipynb).

### 2. Object Detection

Build a deep convolutional neural network to detect objects in images.  See here for [the completed project](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/deep-learning/tree/master/project2).

### 3. Generate TV Scripts

Use a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate novel faces.

# Practice Problems
On top of the core projects, this repo will also include practice problems covering a range of Machine Learning Algorithms.

1. Linear Regression
